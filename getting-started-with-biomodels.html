                    style="margin-top: 20px">General rules for usernames and passwords</h3>
                <p>When opening an account in BioModels repository, you are required to choose a
                    username and are sent a temporary password via the confirmation email. Usernames
                    and passwords must match the conventions set by BioModels. To make sure that your username and
                    password are
                    accepted, follow the guidelines below.</p>
                <h4 id="username-requirements">Username requirements</h4>
                <p>Your username can be any combination of letters, numbers and these symbols (underscores, dots and
                    hyphens). The
                    username must match with this regular expression <code>/^[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]{4,64}$/g</code>.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Usernames can be between 4 and 64 characters in length.</li>
                    <li>Usernames may contain any of the following: letters (a - z or A - Z), numbers (0 - 9), dashes
                        (-), underscores
                        (_), hyphens (-), and periods (.).
                    </li>
                    <li>Usernames may not contain any of the following; ampersands (&), equal signs (=), brackets (< >),
                        plus signs (+),
                        commas (,), or more than one period (.) in a row.
                    </li>
                    <li>Usernames may not begin or end with a period (.), nor can a period (.) be the only character.
                    </li>
                    <li>Letters in usernames must be lowercase. If you enter uppercase letters when creating a username,
                        they are converted to lowercase letters.</li>

                </ul>

                <h4 id="password-requirements">Password requirements</h4>
                <p>Your password can be any combination of letters, numbers, and symbols (ASCII-standard characters
                    only). Accents and accented characters aren't supported.</p>
                <p>You cannot use a password that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is particularly week. For example: "admin123"</li>
                    <li>You've used before on your account.</li>
                    <li>It starts or ends with a blank space.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 id="enhance-account-security-settings">Enhancements of account security settings</h3>
                <h4 id="lock-account-after-failed-password-attempts">Lock accounts after failed password attempts</h4>
                <p>By limiting the number of failed login attempts, the risk of unauthorized system access via user
                    password guessing, also known as brute-forcing, is reduced. We have implemented the smart lockout
                    policy. By default, smart lockout locks an account from login after 3 failed password attempts.</p>
                <h5>
                    <blockquote style="color: #47C965">The lock lasts about an hour and will then clear on its own.</blockquote>
                </h5>
                <p>If the lock does not clear after an hour, please contact us for further support.</p>

                <h5>Why does X lock accounts?</h5>
                <p>BioModels limits the number of times that someone can try signing in to an account for security
                    reasons. We
                    don't want to give hackers unlimited attempts at guessing your password. So, we block them from
                    trying after a while.</p>

                <h4 id="password-compromised">Check and remind if your password was compromised</h4>
                <p>When you create and store your own passwords in BioModels, it automatically identifies common
                    weaknesses (for example, if they're easily guessed or used multiple times). BioModels can also
                    securely monitor your passwords and alert you via either sending an email or pushing a
                    notification to your profile's <strong>Notifications</strong> section if they appear in known data
                    leaks.</p>
                <p>BioModels will perform a password check when any user logs in the system. You cannot stop our
                    system from sending alerts unless you reset your current password.</p>

                <h4 id="2fa">Turn Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) on or off</h4>
                <p>Two-factor authentication (2FA) is an identity and access management security method that requires
                    two steps of identification to access resources and data. 2FA gives BioModels platform the
                    ability to monitor and help safeguard their most vulnerable information and networks.</p>
                <h5>The Benefits of 2FA</h5>
                <dl class="benefits-2fa-list">
                    <dt>Enhanced security</dt>
                    <dd>Probably the most important benefit of 2FA is to provide an additional layer of
                        security. Even if a hacker obtains the password/login credentials of a user,
                        they still cannot access the data without a second factor of authentication.
                        This makes it hard for (cyber)criminals to hack into sensitive information and
                        protects the data from unauthorized access.</dd>
                    <dt>Reduce Risk of Fraud & Data Breaches</dt>
                    Data breaches have serious consequences for businesses: reputation damage, legal
                    liabilities and even financial losses. But luckily, the days of being able to crack
                    a simple password and gain access to privileged information are over. As stated above,
                    the enhanced security makes the life of a hacker much harder. Not only to protect
                    individual user data, but also lowering the risk of a (large) data breach significantly.</dd>
                    <dt>Achieve Compliance</dt>
                    <dd>Some industries require specific compliance measures, such as GDPR and HIPAA.
                        Health, finance, and government entities demand that businesses follow strict
                        guidelines that protect consumers’ rights and mitigate risk. Make sure you
                        consider your business' unique needs when determining your security requirements.</dd>
                    <dt>Increase Customer Trust</dt>
                    <dd>Customers like knowing their data is secure. Even though additional verification
                        steps can seem annoying and unnecessary at times, customers trust and appreciate
                        businesses who take precautions to protect them seriously.</dd>
                    <dt>Reduce Operating Costs</dt>
                    <dd>2FA helps reduce the occurrence of fraud, and thus frees time for the help desk
                        to focus on more complex customer service issues. But that's not all! Compared
                        to other security measures (biometric authentication or physical security tokens),
                        2FA is relatively low-cost and easy to implement. This makes it a practical and
                        cost-effective option for businesses of all sizes, including small and medium-sized
                        enterprises.</dd>
                    <dt>Increase Flexibility</dt>
                    <dd>There are many different types of 2FA solutions available, on a variety of different
                        messaging channels. This means that you can choose the option that best suits your
                        customer's needs, your security requirements, your budget, and your IT infrastructure.</dd>
                </dl>
                <h5>Authentication methods for 2FA</h5>
                <p>There are different authentication methods when using two-factor authentication. Currently, we
                    only support users <strong>getting OTP codes for 2FA via email</strong>.</p>
                <h5>Trust this device for 30 days</h5>
                <p>To enhance your login experience and reduce interruptions, we've also introduced a new <strong>Trust
                        This
                    Device for 30 Days</strong> feature during the 2FA process.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold">Key Benefits:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Users can now choose to recognize their regularly used devices for 30 days, minimizing the need
                           for
                        repeated 2FA prompts on those devices.</li>
                    <li>This feature improves workflow efficiency, especially during busy periods when frequent
                    authentication might slow down user activities.</li>
                    <li>Users can view and manage their trusted devices directly through the user profile page, giving
                           full control over which devices are recognized as trusted.
                </li>
                    <p>By enabling this option during login, you can enjoy a smoother, more efficient authentication
                        experience on your trusted devices.</p>
